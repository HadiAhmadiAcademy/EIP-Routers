# Sample Implementation of Routers from "Enterprise Integration Patterns" Book

This repository contains sample code for various routers described in the book "[Enterprise Integration Patterns](https://www.amazon.com/Enterprise-Integration-Patterns-Designing-Addison-Wesley-ebook/dp/B007MQLL4E)" by Gregor Hohpe and Bobby Woolf. These routers illustrate common integration patterns used in enterprise applications and can serve as a starting point for your own integration projects.

:warning: Please note that the sample routers provided in this repository are intended for educational purposes only and may not be suitable for use in production systems without additional testing and modifications. We strongly recommend that you exercise caution and thoroughly evaluate the suitability of these routers for your specific use case before using them in any real-world application.

# Structure

The code is the way that each sample has its own branch containing the code and a README file that explains how the router works and how it can be used. The code is written in C# and uses the MassTransit framework.
